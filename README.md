#### My version of Risk board game Blitz action.
###  Speed up Risk board game duels with this duel calculator

Simply enter how many units the atacker has, then how many units the defender has and press Blitz.

The calculator rolls the number of dice required and plays attack and defend rounds until the attacker can attack no more.

### But what if I just want one round

That's ok, just press either 1,2,3 for the number of defending units and the 2 or 3 for the attacking units.

Then press Blitz, and it will calculate only one round.
